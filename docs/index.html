In countries with the highest adolescent fertility rates, girls ages 15-19 are also less likely to finish school and enter the labor force, and more likely to get married by the age of 18.</p> <p>Worldwide, over the last five decades the rate of adolescent fertility has halved – from 86 live births per 1,000 women ages 15 to 19 in 1970 to 42 in 2018. The trend in adolescent fertility has been downward in all regions across the world, albeit with large differences between countries.</p> </div> </div>  <div class="col-12">  <iframe src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/5048247/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="width:100%;height:600px;" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"></iframe><div style="width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;"><a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/5048247/?utm_source=embed&utm_campaign=visualisation/5048247" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none!important"></a></div> </div> </div>  <div id="vis" class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-9 offset-2">  <p>Each bubble represents a country; the radius represents the total adolescent fertility rate of the year. </p> <span class="dotsmall"></span> 20 births per 1000 adolescents <span class="dotbig"></span>100 births per 1,000 adolescents<p></p> <p><i>Hover over the bubble to get more information.</i></p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-12 sticky"> <div id="chart-4"></div> </div> <div class="col-6 offset-3" style="pointer-events:none"> <div class="step" id="origin"> <p><span class="colored-text">Each bubble represents a country, the radius represents the total adolescent fertility rate of year 2018.</span></p> </div> <div class="step" id="asia"> <p><span class="colored-text">Today, adolescent fertility ranges from 0.3 births per 1,000 young women in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to 184 births per 1,000 young women in Niger.</span></p> </div> <div class="step" id="arab-spring"> <p><span class="colored-text">In 2018, 22 countries, all in Sub-Saharan Africa, exceeded 100 births per 1,000 adolescent women. </span></p> </div> <div class="step" id="split"> <p><span class="colored-text">Each cluster of bubbles represents a world region.</span></p> </div> <div class="step" id="split-highlight"> <p><span class="colored-text">The countries with the highest estimated adolescent fertility rates for each region are highlighted. </span></p> </div> <div class="step" id="split-highlight"> <p><span class="colored-text">Despite marked improvements, adolescent fertility remains the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean with 101 and 62 births per 1,000 young women, respectively, in 2018. </span></p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-9 offset-2"> <p>Regional aggregate data of this type may conceal substantial differences between countries, especially when tracking progress over time. Some countries like Ghana have shown significant improvements in adolescent fertility, child marriage and keeping girls in school.</p> The adolescent fertility rate in Ghana gradually fell from 148 in 1960 to 66 in 2018. Girls are likely to complete secondary school, though the differences between affluent families from urban areas and low-income families from the rural parts are sharp. Now only 20 percent of women ages 20-24 are first married by the age of 18, half of the rate in 1988 which was 40 percent.<p></p> These signs of change in Ghana are indicative of the potential for progress in other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, where child marriage and adolescent fertility rates have declined only at a modest pace. West and Central Africa have the highest prevalence of child marriage.<p></p> In Niger, where adolescent fertility rate is the highest globally, girls are likely to only go to school until the age of 10, as many are married and have children early. About 18.4 percent of girls gave birth before the age of 18. The country also has the world's highest early marriage rates, with 76 percent of women ages 20-24 first married by the age of 18 and 28 percent by the age of 15.<p></p> Underlying such high rates are socio-economic factors and entrenched social norms, particularly in Niger and northern Nigeria, where religious and cultural norms often praise women who aspire to be successful wives and mothers with large families.<p></p> <p></p> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-9 offset-2"> <h1 style="font-family:inherit;text-align:center;font-size:1.3rem;line-height:1.2;font-weight:700;color:#333;margin:0;padding-top:0;">A day in the life of a girl in the country with the highest rate, Niger.</h1> <br> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-9 offset-2"> <p>The costs of child marriage are considerable for young girls, their families, and their communities. Child marriage poses a significant risk to girls' fundamental human rights, including their ability to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, be educated, and own property. A married girl may need to stop attending school because of societal expectations, pregnancy, and housework responsibilities such as caring for children or other relatives.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div id="scrollytell" data-story-id="816307"> <span class="colored-text">While girl child marriage is far more likely in some countries, it is a concern worldwide. In Sub-Saharan Africa where adolescent fertility is high, each year 15 million girls marry before the age of 18. Latin America and the Caribbean is another region where the prevalence of child marriage barely changed over the past 25 years.</span> <span class="colored-text">The relationship between child marriage and educational attainment for girls is also apparent. It is expected that once they are married, it is difficult for girls to remain in school. </span> <span class="colored-text">However, the relationship between pregnancy and not attending school could also happen in reverse. Girls who are out of school are also more likely to bear children before they turn 18. </span> <span class="colored-text">In Sub-Saharan Africa, teenage pregnancy is one of the major hindrances to the educational success of young girls.</span> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-9 offset-2"> <p>A World Bank report "The Cost of Not Educating Girls" (2018) suggests that girls enrolled in school are less likely to become teenage mothers. On average, an additional year of secondary school is associated with lower risks of adolescent childbearing and marrying by six percentage points. In fact, policy makers have successfully implemented programs that focus on improved schooling that aim to also reduce adolescent fertility.</p> <p>Programs that work directly with girls, like the UNFPA-UNICEF Global Programme to End Child Marriage, have been successful in increasing the share of girls who stay in school. </p> <p>Another example is the SWEDD project implemented between 2015 and 2020 in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger. The regional initiative helps girls gain control of their sexual and reproductive health, stay in school, and have better economic opportunities. </p> <p>However, even though the Sub-Saharan region's low female school attendance rates relate to high adolescent fertility rates, the trend in the Latin America and the Caribbean region is different. The trend since the late 1960s has indicated a reverse gender gap where more girls enroll in and complete school than boys. Instead, there is concern that adolescent girls make up 27 percent of youth not in education, employment, or training (NEET). The likelihood of employment is even lower among adolescent girls who are mothers. Youth training programs aim to address both the high rates of adolescent fertility and female NEET population. Juventud y Empleo in the Dominican Republic is one example of how reducing teenage pregnancy results in better opportunities for young women in the labor market and improved access to better quality jobs and earnings.</p> </div> </div> <div class="col-12">  <iframe src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/5449363/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="width:100%;height:600px;" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"></iframe><div style="width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;"><a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/5449363/?utm_source=embed&utm_campaign=visualisation/5449363" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none!important"> </a></div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-9 offset-2"> <p>The Dominican Republic has the highest adolescent fertility rate and number of girls married by age 18 in the Latin America and Caribbean region. However, it only has thirty percent of the female NEET population, a tribute to these youth training programs. Though many of these young women contribute to the economy and households through unpaid jobs, domestic work, and as caregivers, the aforementioned programs encourage adolescent girls to transition into the labor force.</p> <p>The COVID-19 pandemic stands in the way of interventions that are carried out worldwide to bring an end to these issues.</p> <p>In the present COVID-19 crisis, young women's social and economic integration in the region poses a more significant challenge. Women face compounding burdens because they continue to do the majority of the unpaid care work in households, face high risks of economic insecurity, and face increased threats of gender-based violence.</p> <p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries made continued improvements in adolescent girls’ health, education, and labor force participation. But the effects of the pandemic threaten to reverse the progress over the past decades.</p> <p>Lessons from the Ebola outbreak indicate that women and girls were the most affected by school closures, and reduced work hours or loss of jobs for women with childcare responsibilities. On the other hand, women make up a larger share of frontline responders and traditional caretakers of the sick, and therefore were often at increased risk of exposure. Furthermore, strained health systems and gender-based violence during the outbreak were likely to have contributed to the increases in pregnancies among young girls, many of whom did not return to school.</p> <p>Similar situations can occur during the current period. While it is still too soon to see the COVID-19's pandemic's full effect on adolescent fertility, media reports suggest more teenage girls became pregnant since the containment measures started.</p> <p>However, even in such conflictive environments, youth clubs and diverse initiatives have demonstrated positive results in the past by increasing school enrollment and reducing teenage pregnancy in times of abrupt changes.</p> <p>How countries recover from the effects of the COVID-19 health and economic crisis to address teenage pregnancy will depend heavily on local decisions and policies, as outlined in the World Bank's Gender Dimensions of the COVID-19 Pandemic brief.</p> <p></p> </div> </div>  <div class="col-9 offset-2"> <div> <div id="#cartogram"> <svg/> </div> </div> </div> <div class="container-fluid"> <footer class="col-9 offset-2"> <p style="font-family:inherit;text-align:center;font-size:.7rem;line-height:1.2;font-weight:lighter;color:#333;margin:0;padding-top:0;"> By: Coral Negrón <br> Note: Data shown is from 2010 through 2018 <br> Source: World Bank<br> <br> <br> February 2021 <br> <br> <button id="myBtn" title="Go to top" class="button">Back to top</button> </p></footer> </div> <script src="cartogram.d80c260d.js"></script> <script src="04-chart.a622ce77.js"></script> <script src="scrollytelling.f835ddb1.js"></script> <script src="script.2b2a33f6.js" async></script> </body></html>
