        <p>Adolescent fertility is widely recognized as having significant consequences for young women. Early child-bearing is associated with lower schooling levels, child marriage, and worse labor market outcomes for young women. Despite these implications and notwithstanding downward trends in many countries, in many parts of the world, rates of adolescent fertility remain persistently high.</p>

          <p>Regional data conceal substantial differences between countries, especially when tracking progress over time. Some countries, like Ghana, have shown significant improvements with regards to lowering adolescent fertility, decreasing rates of child marriage, and keeping girls in school.</p>  
          <p>The adolescent fertility rate in Ghana gradually fell from 148 in 1960 to 66 in 2018.  One in five women ages 20-24 were first married by the age of 18-- half of the rate in 1988 which was 40 percent. And girls in Ghana are more likely to <a href='https://databank.worldbank.org/id/2ddc971b?Code=HD.HCI.EYRS.FE&report_name=Gender_Indicators_Report&populartype=series'>complete</a> secondary school compared to their peers in in other Sub-Saharan African countries. Still, the <a href='https://www.unicef.org/ghana/girls-education'>differences</a> a between affluent families from urban areas and low-income families from the rural parts are large.  Moreover, Ghana is an outlier in the subregion. West and Central Africa have the highest prevalence of child marriage.<br></p>
          <p>In Niger, where adolescent fertility rate is the highest globally, on average, girls get only 3 years of school. About one in five young women will have given birth before the age of 18. The country also has the world's highest rate of early marriage, with 76 percent of women ages 20-24 first married by the age of 18 and 28 percent by the age of 15.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.unicef.org/protection/child-marriage">costs of child marriage</a> are considerable for adolescent girls, their families, and their communities. Child marriage poses a significant risk to girls' fundamental <a href="https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/digest7e.pdf">human rights</a>, including their ability to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, be educated, and own property. Being married and in school typically are not compatible because of societal expectations, pregnancy, housework responsibilities such as caring for children or other relatives, and, in some cases due to explicit/implicit education policies. Moreover, the risk of experiencing <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/46/2/662/2417355">domestic violence</a> is higher among women who marry early.

      <span class='colored-text'>Latin America and the Caribbean is another region where the prevalence of child marriage <a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/1-4-young-women-latin-america-and-caribbean-union-or-married-age-18">barely changed</a> over the past 25 years.</span>

      <span class='colored-text'>It is expected that once girls are married, it is difficult for them to remain in school –if not due to explicitly policies, then due to implicit rules and time demands at home.</span>

      <p>On average, an additional year of secondary school is associated with <a href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/775261531234655903/missed-opportunities-the-high-cost-of-not-educating-girls">lower risks</a> of adolescent childbearing and marrying by six percentage points. Similar to Sub-Saharan Africa, in several countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, especially in <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/16978/831670v20REVIS00Box385190B00PUBLIC0.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y">Central America</a>, low female school attendance rates relate are correlated to high adolescent fertility rates. </p>
      <p>However, conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs like Subsidio Educativo in Colombia proved that an economic assistance approach could <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/bejeap-2014-0162/html">reduce</a> teenage pregnancy in secondary school students. Beneficiaries of the program lose the transfer if they do not comply with a minimum daily attendance requirement.</p>
      <p>In the last decade, Latin America and the Caribbean has experienced <a href="file:///C%3A/Users/wb575939/Downloads/LAC%20Gender%20Note%203-%20REDUCING%20TEEN%20PREGNANCY%20(2).pdf">gains</span></a> in gender parity in primary school enrollment. In fact, regional trends indicate a reverse gender gap where more girls enroll in and complete school than boys. Still, young women who are out of school face other hurdles to economic empowerment than young men. Teenage girls make up <a href="https://www.oecd.org/dev/americas/Overview_LEO2017.pdf">76 percent </a> of youth not in education, employment, or training (NEET). The likelihood of employment is even <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/16978/831670v20REVIS00Box385190B00PUBLIC0.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y">lower</span></a> among adolescent girls who are mothers. </span></p>
      <p>LAC is the region that has the world <a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/stable-families-and-educational-progress-in-latin-america/">highest rates</span></a> of nonmarital childbearing. The incidence of unpartnered motherhood is highest for women with less education. Single mothers with no more than primary education have th <a href="https://paa2013.princeton.edu/papers/131081"> lowest chances</span></a> of co-habiting or co-parenting; they face the double burden of having lower own-income earning power and inome resources from partners. Both factors contribute to their overall disadvantaged position.</span></p>
      <p>Youth training programs aim to address both the high rates of adolescent fertility and the female NEET population.<a href="https://izajold.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40175-016-0065-7"> Juventud y Empleo </a> in the Dominican Republic is one example of how reducing teenage pregnancy results in better opportunities for young women in the labor market and improved access to better quality jobs and earnings</span></p>
      <p>While the Dominican Republic has the highest adolescent fertility rate and number of girls married by age 18 in the Latin America and Caribbean region, its share of the female youth population who are NEET is only the 9th highest in the region, a tribute to such youth training programs.</p> </div>

                  <br>
                  <p>The COVID-19 crisis poses further major challenges to greater success in young women's social and economic integration. Women face <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2020/05/15/covid-19-could-worsen-gender-inequality-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean">compounding burdens</a>, because they continue to do the majority of the unpaid care work in households, face higher risks of economic insecurity than men, and face increased threats of gender-based violence.</p>
                  <p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries made continued improvements in adolescent girls' health, education, and labor force participation. But the effects of the pandemic<a href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/618731587147227244/gender-dimensions-of-the-covid-19-pandemic"> threaten</a> to reverse the progress over the past decades.</p>
                  <p>While the evidence on these impacts is still emerging, media reports suggest more <a href="https://plan-international.org/news/2020-06-25-covid-19-lockdown-linked-high-number-unintended-teen-pregnancies-kenya">teenage girls</a> have <a href="https://www.wvi.org/sites/default/files/2020-08/Covid19%20Aftershocks_Access%20Denied_small.pdf">become pregnant</a> since the <a href="https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/99/1/21-020121/en/">containment measures</a> started. 
                  <p>Recovery efforts and policies need to ensure continued and expanded investments in the human development of adolescent girls for more inclusive and sustainable growth, as outlined in the <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/33622">World Bank's Gender Dimensions of the COVID-19 Pandemic brief.</a></p>
